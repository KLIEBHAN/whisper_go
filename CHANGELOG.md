## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Windows support with dedicated daemon (`pulsescribe_windows.py`)
- Centralized animation logic (`ui/animation.py`) for cross-platform consistency
- PyInstaller spec for Windows EXE builds
- Default hotkeys for Windows (Toggle: Ctrl+Alt+R, Hold: Ctrl+Win)

### Changed
- Synchronized animations between Windows and macOS
- Tuned animation constants to match macOS feel

### Fixed
- Hold flag reset in `_stop_recording()` on Windows

## [1.1.1] - 2024-12-XX

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Crash on macOS 26 (Tahoe) due to UI updates from background threads
  - All UI updates now dispatched to main thread via `NSOperationQueue.mainQueue()`
- Missing loading feedback when model loads on-demand (without preload)
- Model name not updating after settings change

### Changed
- Phase-based loading status ("Loading turbo...", "Warming up...")
- Blue loading animation in overlay (distinct from orange transcribing animation)
- Thread-safe `_update_state()` with automatic main-thread dispatching

## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-XX

### Added
- **Lightning Mode:** `lightning-whisper-mlx` backend for ~4x faster local transcription on Apple Silicon
- Loading indicator in menu bar during model download/init
- Automatic Lightning → MLX fallback on errors
- 33 new unit tests for Lightning backend

### Fixed
- `[Errno 30] Read-only file system: 'mlx_models'` when running from DMG
  - Lightning models now stored in `~/.pulsescribe/lightning_models/`
- `beam_size` ENV variable incorrectly applied to Lightning/MLX backends
- `language="auto"` now correctly triggers auto-detection

### Changed
- Removed legacy Raycast daemon/IPC code
- Added `mlx_models/` to `.gitignore`

## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-XX

### Added
- **System-wide dictation workflow**
  - Global hotkeys (Toggle + Hold-to-record / Push-to-talk)
  - Voice activity detection for fast start/stop
  - Instant feedback via menu bar + animated overlay (~170ms ready time)
  - Auto-paste: copies to clipboard + sends Cmd+V

- **Multiple transcription providers**
  - Deepgram (WebSocket streaming, ~300ms latency)
  - Groq (REST, very fast Whisper on LPU)
  - OpenAI (REST, GPT-4o Transcribe, highest quality)
  - Local (offline, no API costs)
    - `whisper`: openai-whisper (PyTorch), MPS on Apple Silicon
    - `faster`: faster-whisper (CTranslate2), CPU-optimized
    - `mlx`: mlx-whisper (MLX/Metal), Apple Silicon GPU

- **LLM post-processing ("Refine")**
  - Removes filler words, fixes grammar, formats paragraphs
  - Context-aware style based on active app (email/chat/code/default)
  - Spoken punctuation/formatting commands
  - Providers: Groq, OpenAI, OpenRouter

- **Advanced local performance tuning**
  - Settings UI with local knobs (device, warmup, fast decoding, etc.)
  - Built-in presets for common macOS setups (including MLX presets)

- **Custom vocabulary**
  - `~/.pulsescribe/vocabulary.json` for domain-specific terms

- **Native UI**
  - Menu bar status (🎤 🔴 ⏳ ✅ ❌)
