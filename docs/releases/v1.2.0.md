# v1.2.0 - Windows MVP

**Release Date:** 2025-12-27

## Highlights

This release marks the **Windows MVP milestone** with a fully-featured Windows daemon, Settings GUI, and installer.

### Windows Support (New!)

- **Dedicated daemon** (`pulsescribe_windows.py`) with System Tray integration
- **Settings GUI** with PySide6 and Mica backdrop effect (Windows 11)
- **Onboarding wizard** for first-time setup
- **Inno Setup installer** with Start Menu entries and autostart option
- **Default hotkeys:** Toggle = `Ctrl+Alt+R`, Hold = `Ctrl+Win`
- **GPU-accelerated overlay** with real-time waveform visualization

### Build System Improvements

- **`-Local` build flag**: Two build variants for Windows:
  - **API-only** (default): ~30MB, Cloud APIs only (Deepgram, OpenAI, Groq)
  - **Local** (`-Local`): ~4GB, includes CUDA Whisper for offline use
- Optimized PySide6 bundling (shiboken6 bindings included)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed **last word cutoff** in Deepgram streaming (audio queue drain)
- Fixed **PySide6 not loading** in bundled EXE (missing shiboken6)
- Fixed multiple settings/onboarding windows opening simultaneously
- Fixed NVIDIA DLL discovery for cuDNN/cuBLAS on Windows
- Fixed UTF-8 encoding for `prompts.toml` on Windows
- Fixed subprocess stdout deadlock prevention

| ----------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `PulseScribe-1.2.0.dmg`             | ~434 MB | macOS (Universal, Apple Silicon + Intel) |
| `PulseScribe-Setup-1.2.0.exe`       | ~30 MB  | Windows – Cloud APIs (recommended)       |
| `PulseScribe-Setup-1.2.0-Local.exe` | ~4 GB   | Windows – with faster-whisper (offline)  |

### Which Windows Installer to Choose?

- **API-only (recommended)**: For most users. Uses cloud services (Deepgram, OpenAI, Groq) for fast, high-quality transcription.
- **Local**: For offline use or when privacy matters. Includes faster-whisper for local transcription.

### Important Notes for Local Variant

> **First-time setup:** On first use, the Local variant downloads ~1.5 GB of model data (Whisper turbo model). An internet connection is required for this initial download. After that, transcription works fully offline.
>
> **GPU Support:** The bundled installer runs on **CPU only** (int8 optimized, still reasonably fast). For NVIDIA GPU acceleration, you need to manually install [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) – see [Local Backends](../LOCAL_BACKENDS.md#windows-gpu-support) for instructions.
>
> **Performance:** CPU transcription with `turbo` model takes 5–10 seconds for 10 seconds of audio on modern 8-core CPUs.

## Installation

### macOS

Download `PulseScribe-1.2.0.dmg`, open it, and drag PulseScribe to Applications.

### Windows

Download the appropriate installer and run it. Alternatively, build from source:

```powershell
# API-only (recommended, ~30MB)
.\build_windows.ps1 -Clean -Installer

# With local CUDA Whisper (~4GB)
.\build_windows.ps1 -Clean -Installer -Local
```
