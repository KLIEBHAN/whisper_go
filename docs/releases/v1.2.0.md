# v1.2.0 - Windows MVP

**Release Date:** 2025-12-27

## Highlights

This release marks the **Windows MVP milestone** with a fully-featured Windows daemon, Settings GUI, and installer.

### Windows Support (New!)

- **Dedicated daemon** (`pulsescribe_windows.py`) with System Tray integration
- **Settings GUI** with PySide6 and Mica backdrop effect (Windows 11)
- **Onboarding wizard** for first-time setup
- **Inno Setup installer** with Start Menu entries and autostart option
- **Default hotkeys:** Toggle = `Ctrl+Alt+R`, Hold = `Ctrl+Win`
- **GPU-accelerated overlay** with real-time waveform visualization

### Build System Improvements

- **`-Local` build flag**: Two build variants for Windows:
  - **API-only** (default): ~30MB, Cloud APIs only (Deepgram, OpenAI, Groq)
  - **Local** (`-Local`): ~4GB, includes CUDA Whisper for offline use
- Optimized PySide6 bundling (shiboken6 bindings included)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed **last word cutoff** in Deepgram streaming (audio queue drain)
- Fixed **PySide6 not loading** in bundled EXE (missing shiboken6)
- Fixed multiple settings/onboarding windows opening simultaneously
- Fixed NVIDIA DLL discovery for cuDNN/cuBLAS on Windows
- Fixed UTF-8 encoding for `prompts.toml` on Windows
- Fixed subprocess stdout deadlock prevention
