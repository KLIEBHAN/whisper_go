# PulseScribe v1.1.1

**Bugfix: macOS 26 (Tahoe) Compatibility + Improved Loading Feedback**

- **Download:** [PulseScribe-1.1.1.dmg](https://github.com/KLIEBHAN/pulsescribe/releases/download/v1.1.1/PulseScribe-1.1.1.dmg)
- **Build target:** Apple Silicon (`arm64`)

## Important: First launch on macOS (Gatekeeper)

This release is **not notarized** (ad-hoc signed). On first launch, macOS may block it with a dialog like:

"Apple could not check if 'PulseScribe' is free of malware…".

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **To open it anyway, run these commands in Terminal:**
>
> ```bash
> sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PulseScribe.app
> open /Applications/PulseScribe.app
> ```

## What's Fixed

### Critical: macOS 26 (Tahoe) Crash on Startup

PulseScribe crashed immediately on macOS 26 with:

```
EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)
Must only be used from the main thread
```

**Cause:** macOS 26 introduced stricter thread-safety checks for AppKit. UI updates from background threads (which were tolerated in macOS 15) now cause immediate crashes.

**Fix:** All UI updates are now dispatched to the main thread via `NSOperationQueue.mainQueue()`.

### Improved Loading Feedback

When local models are loading, you now see phase-based status updates:

| Phase         | Overlay Text       | Menubar |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| Model Loading | "Loading turbo..." | ⬇️      |
| Warmup        | "Warming up..."    | ⬇️      |
| Ready         | —                  | 🎤      |

The overlay now shows a **blue pulsing animation** during loading, making it clear that the app is working (not frozen).

## Changes since v1.1.0

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed:** Crash on macOS 26 (Tahoe) due to UI updates from background threads
- **Fixed:** Missing loading feedback when model loads on-demand (without preload)
- **Fixed:** Model name not updating after settings change (always showed "Loading turbo...")

### Improvements

- Phase-based loading status ("Loading turbo...", "Warming up...")
- Blue loading animation in overlay (distinct from orange transcribing animation)
- Thread-safe `_update_state()` with automatic main-thread dispatching

## Upgrading from v1.1.0

1. Download the new DMG
2. Replace `/Applications/PulseScribe.app`

Your existing settings in `~/.pulsescribe/.env` are preserved.
